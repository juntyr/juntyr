## Hi there ðŸŒˆ

I'm Juniper [they/them], a PhD researcher at the [University of Helsinki][uh-profile] [^1][^2]. [^3]

> Protecting our planet and the incredible species we share it with are very close to my heart. I am utilising computer science to provide support in attacking these global problems.

My research is focused on fearless lossy compression for weather and climate science. I also work on reproducible computing for scientific collaboration and outreach. [^4]

I enjoy writing scientific software, primarily in Rust ðŸ¦€ with some Python sprinkled in. I also contribute to various open-source communities, e.g. around WebAssembly.

[^2]: I graduated from the University of Helsinki with an MSc in Theoretical and Computational Methods in 2023.
